    "This is the algorithm which returns the best cost optimal solution by exploring all the vertices. We will insert each vertex with it's cost taken from parent node to reach to it. So we are taking them as kind of list and inserting for simplicity. Next we need to use an priority queue which will have vertices sorted based on their costs. So we are using a sorting algorithm at last after insertions of adjacent corresponding vertices of current node. During insertion we have to be careful that it the vertex that we are inserting is aldready present in the queue then t's cost has to be checked if it can be reached with less cost compared to old one and need to update it's parent even. In this way UCS got to be known as variant of <b>Dijikstra’s algorithm</b>. This is the explaination of UCS. (The part of code below takes atleast 1 to 2 minutes to run please wait!)"
